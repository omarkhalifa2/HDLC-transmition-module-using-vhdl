# HDLC-transmition-module-using-vhdl

this repository is dedicated to the implementation of the HDLC protocole on an FPGA  circuit using VHDL , the code is pretty basic as i tried to keep it as simple as possible , if you find any trouble reading the code you contact me on my email (omar.tafsi@gmail.com) or start an issue on the code itself and i'll be happy to help , if you think there is any error then please report it so we can fix it as soon as possible.
